# Classi-cation-of-Movies-and-Books-by-Genre-Using-BERT
Our approach was to try to ﬁne tune BERT to determine a movie’s or a book’s genre by its plot summary and the genre’s deﬁnition.  In order to do so, we used binary classification: our inputs were pairs of a plot summary and a genre’s definition, the model’s task was to predict if the movie was in fact of that specific genre or not, by predicting 1 if they were a match and 0 otherwise.
